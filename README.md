## ðŸ’­ Reflections ðŸ’­
***
This project was indeed a steep climb. The process of setting up the dev-environment was a struggle (mostly due to the dependencies versions from the Technigo template not working in tandem with my npm&node versions.) However after I got started I managed to setup a decent project. 

I am happy that I managed to challenge myself and try a library (Reac-Native-Paper) that was new to me and still make it work together with all the other packages. 

<br>

Issues that came up:
- The biggest struggle was that React-Navigation (and the setup I did) made it hard (if not impossible) to use the hook `useEffect`. After trial and error I managed to get my results by using a hook from React-Navigation called `useFocusEffect` together with `useCallback` to make sure that my states on the Screen Navigator components updated after a route navigation.
- Another issue was to get the React-Native element **Flatlist** to work with my setup. Instead I opted for a **ScrollView** with a **RefreshControl** component. 
- Lastly I struggled to create a warning system for the user if they open the drawer while editing in the profile page. I want to show an alert if they try to navigate away while editing. Which works with Tabs and Screens. But the Drawer Navigator component doesn't have a listener that I can use in my `useEffect` hook. I am sure that I can solve it, but time ran away from me so I decided to scrap that feature for this release. 


If I were to continue on this project / start over I would:
- I would add an warning if user navigates away during editing
- Add a Movie details page for each movie
